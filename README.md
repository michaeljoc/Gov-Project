# Gov-Project

This project imports SAP details, filter out candidates when they do not meet conditions (this code has been redacted due to request).

With the remaining candidate details, it is then merged with pre-existing candidate details (blue card etc) and it is outputted for report (report  function got redacted due to request, it originally would insert the data directly into word document, properly formatted)
